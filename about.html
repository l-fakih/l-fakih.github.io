        <h1>⋆˚࿔ About Lara 𝜗𝜚˚⋆</h1>
        <p>My name is Lara, and I am 22 years old. Prior to enrolling in CS50, I had no background in computer science. This course marks my first experience with programming and it was quite a journey!</p>
        <p>I started CS50 in August 2023, I remember quitting my job of 3 years because I was going through some hardships at work. Plus, I was tired of working as a call center agent and decided to upgrade my career. If it weren't for my friend Mostafa, I would have never considered computer science, we studied together and are currently on the same path!</p>
        <p>CS50 was very fun and interesting, although I did struggle most of the time with the problem sets( ꩜ ᯅ ꩜;),⁭ ⁭however the best part about this course is the challenge. It requires absolute patience and never backing down quickly without putting in effort.</p>
        <p>I found SQL to be the most challenging language to work with. While it initially seems straightforward, it becomes increasingly complex as you delve deeper into its functionality. Despite the challenges, SQL captured my interest, and I now wish to pursue it further. Having gained a foundational understanding, I believe it holds significant potential for the future.</p>
